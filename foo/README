Compilation Instructions:
**********
The script go includes a call to javac - no compilation is necessary.  

**********
Running instructions:
**********
Invoke ./go <input file> <output file>  in the same directory as the Assignment1.java file.  

Go assumes that javac and java are both located in /lusr/bin/ 

This is true for the CS linux machines, however if running elsewhere, please change the two lines in go to rectify the change.

Description:
**********
